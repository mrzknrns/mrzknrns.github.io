<br> I've dabbled in UX/UI design and video editing, mostly picking up these skills on my own because I'm really into it. I love creating cool user experiences and videos that pop, and I'm excited to keep leveling up and bringing more creativity to my work!

## TeachSG

For my TeachSG attachment, I created this motivational card specifically for primary school students who were struggling with math. The card was designed to inspire confidence and encourage them as they prepared for their PSLE exams.

Using bright colors, cheerful designs, and a personalized touch with mentor memojis, I aimed to make the card relatable and uplifting, helping the students feel supported and motivated to achieve their best.

## Digital Storytelling

#### Pattoo Tarlour: The Art of the Needle

Here, we interviewed Pattoo Tarlour, a local tattoo business. We explored the artistry, passion, and personal stories behind tattooing in Singapore.

Through interviews with talented artists, visuals of their creative process, and dynamic shots capturing the parlour's ambiance, the documentary highlights the unique culture and meaningful connections that define the space. It celebrates the cultural and artistic significance of tattooing as both a craft and an expression of identity.

## Social Thought and Theory

In this module, we explored the contributions of the founding fathers of Sociology - Marx, Weber and Durkheim. This Social Media assignment looks into Weber's ideas found in the The Protestant Work Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism and Bureaucracy.

Here, we discussed (in a very Gen-Z way) that we have to be (economically) productive every single minute of our day, how we should be "growing money even in our sleep" is increasingly prevalent today. How everything we do now is to be justified in economic terms and we end up losing meaning, becoming disenchanted in life - Here's what we did!

## GIGAWipes - Innovation through Programming

"Innovation does not stop" -- Here, we explored how to incorporate programming in our daily lives. This may or may not be inspired by true events but for this project, we created a prototype of a toilet roll dispenser but... I'll let the video do the talking...
