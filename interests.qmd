<br> I've dabbled in UX/UI design and video editing, mostly picking up these skills on my own because I'm really into it. I love creating cool user experiences and videos that pop, and I'm excited to keep leveling up and bringing more creativity to my work!

## TeachSG

For my TeachSG attachment, I created this motivational card specifically for primary school students who were struggling with math. The card was designed to inspire confidence and encourage them as they prepared for their PSLE exams.

Using bright colors, cheerful designs, and a personalized touch with mentor memojis, I aimed to make the card relatable and uplifting, helping the students feel supported and motivated to achieve their best.

## Artificial Intelligence and Society

In this module, we looked at the benefits and potential downsides of relying on AI. My group focused on leveraging on AI technology to aid in bereavement process. I designed a brochure for a Virtual Memory Garden where users will transported into a virtual space together with their loved ones - as an avatar!
