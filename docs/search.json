The table below provides an outline of the housing prices in Singapore. Using this as a guide, it determines the average salary needed per spouse needed to comfortably afford monthly repayments.\n\n\nFor instance, to afford a 3-room flat, which has a median price of $360,000, both partners would have to at lease earn SGD$5,230. While it may seem manageable, this does not account for other living expenses, or other income fluctuation - couple may own a car, or have multiple kids.\n\n\nImagine you and your sponse are looking to start a family. Now that we’ve a glimpse into the affordability of homes in Singapore, do you think you can comfortably own your own home when the time comes? Let’s dive into real data and discuss this critical issue further.\n\n\n\nTrend of HDB Resale Prices in Singapore\n\nTo understand the trend of housing prices in Singapore, the analysis will use the available data sets from this site. The publicly available data contains historical sales figures on yearly bases, and can be used to access market dynamics and predict future trend.\n\n\nBefore moving on to the deeper analysis, let us understand how the overall prices have increased from 1990 to 2022. While the general increase in prices overtime aligns with economic growth, the rate of the surge from 1990 to 2022 is alarming.\n\n\nOne may argue that the increment is a sign of prospering economy, on the other side, it also rings alarm bells in terms of overall affordability. Now let’s examine the graph below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe graph above illustrates a significant steepening in the slopes of average resale prices in Singapore from 1990 to 2022 - indicating the exorbitant increase of prices across all flat types. The steeper slope in 2022 shows a more prominent price escalation as compared to 1990’s. This is can be an indication increasing pressure on affordability and financial stretch for home ownership.\n\n\nNotice that on the graph, there is a worrying widening price gap between each successive flat type, with the difference in average prices from one flat type to the next becoming more distinct. For example, the price jump from a 3-room to a 4-room for both 1990 and 2022, may point towards a growing demand for a larger home. Larger home, bigger family right?\n\n\nWith that, we can understand that the widening gap of prices could create a cost burden for upgraders seeking more specious accommodations for a bigger family. The growing gap in prices shows that planning for home ownership is extremely crucial to prevent any buyers’ remorse.\n\n\nNow let’s look at the price increment individually for both years, compared with the same flat type.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe interactive graph above compares\n\n\n\nThe Distribution of Resale Flat Prices of Different Flat Types\n\nWhile a price increment can potentially indicate a critical issue with affordability, it is also important to access where the increase is still within the “safe” median range. However, in the box plot below, we can see how the presence of outliers underscores the significant and unprecedented price increase.\n\n\nHint: Pay attention to how 3-room flats almost hitting $1,000,000! On top of that, we can also visually compare the number of outliers in 1990 and 2022, denoted by the green and orange box respectively.\n\n\n\n\nLet’s input all the flat type options, what do you see? With 3-Room, 4-Room, 5-Room and Executive selected, we can see a consistent pattern. The data reveals a distinct trend where “regular-sized” flats are slowly approaching the million-dollar mark in resale price in 2022. The upward trajectory is also an indication of the growth in the resale market, reflecting how people are willing to pay for their dream home. This inevitably affect those within a lower income bracket, preventing them to do the same.\n\n\nFurthermore, across the other flat types, there is an increasing number of outliers beyond the upper whiskers of the box plots for 2022. While this can suggest a substantial market growth, it can also reflect the high number of exceptional cases where resale prices are charging a even higher premium, exceeding the median trends - which is already high.\n\n\nNow, that we have clearly seen the high prices Singaporean are willing to pay for their dream home, are there other factors that can be attributed to the price increase? Next, we will explore if the remaining lease left or the location of the flat affect the resale price.\n\n\n\nThe Impact of Remaining Lease on Resale Prices\n\nTo lower the cost burden for flat upgraders, some may consider purchasing a flat with a lower remaining lease. However, is there a correlation between the remaining lease and the cost of a resale flat?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe influence of Estate on Resale Prices\n\nWe can agree that price is an important consideration for purchasing a home. Have you figured out where to live? Do you want to live close to your parents in the same estate? Or do you have a preferred school you would like to send your future children too?\n\n\nNow, we will examine if the estate affects the price of the resale flat. We will also determine which estate tends to be more costly or cheaper to settle down.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssessing Affordability of Resale Flats in Singapore\n\nSo far, we have looked at the prices of the resale flats, factors such as remaining lease and estate, we will now access if the resale flats are truly affordable for Singaporeans - compared with the average income earned.\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\nYou might be thinking - ” Aren’t there build-to-order (BTO) flats that are way priced way lower with other grants for purchase?” - and you know what, you are absolutely right! But are you willing to ballot with tens and thousands of couples, wait 5-6 years, and then face the possibility of being turned down?\n\n\n\nReferences"
