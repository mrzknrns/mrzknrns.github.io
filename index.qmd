# **My Hello to You \~**

Hello there! My name is Marzuki Nooranas - or *Marz* for short! I am currently in my 2nd year, double majoring in Sociology and, Communications and New Media!

I have always been fascinated by how society functions and its intricate connections, my passion for understanding the world around us, is driven by a desire to foster meaningful connections within all communities!

To demonstrate this, I embark of frequent backpacking trips across Southeast Asia, and actively engage myself in the cultures and learn about their customs.

Such experiences provide me with firsthand insights into how different societies interact, and not only broadening my horizons, but also fostering empathy across different communities. Here's a little snippet!

# **My Past Work**

## National University of Singapore

### DTK1234 - Design Thinking

In this module, we were assigned the task of innovating everyday chores. Here is my idea: it is basically an attachment that can be clipped to an existing ironing board, so that people - including the elderly or people with disabilities - can iron clothes without feeling tired or unsafe

The actual prototyping journey was not very smooth, but hey, here is the end product! Looks good aye? To me at least...

## Temasek Polytechnic

### Savvify - An Automated Savings Platform

During my time in Temasek Polytechnic, my group mates and I worked on an automated savings platform - ***Savvify***. Essentially, the application helps users to round up your payment transactions to the nearest dollar, and crediting it to the users' e-wallet upon making QR Payments.

Our main goal was to bring new solutions e-payment solutions while helping young adults like us, to understand real life responsibilities - improving their financial literacy!

### GIGAWipes - Innovation through Programming

"Innovation does not stop" -- Here, we explored how to incorporate programming in our daily lives. This may or may not be inspired by true events but for this project, we created a prototype of a toilet roll dispenser but... I'll let the video do the talking...
